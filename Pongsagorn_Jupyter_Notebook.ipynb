    "*I am interested in data science because I believe that behind data, there can be insight that we can learn to either making important decision or gain new knowledge that never exists before. Data is one of the most valuable assets that if we can harness, we weill deifinitely gain the advantage. I used to work with a lot of data almost a decade ago, but the tool was mostly Excel. As data has grown exponentially, we need a new knowledge to tackle these data methodically and efficiently. It is a part of the future how we should drive the business. Therefore, I have started my journey in data science.*\n"
